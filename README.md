# Breast Cancer Screening and Management (BCSM) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Implementation Guide

## Local development

### Pre-requisites

#### Node

To check that Node is installed, use the command:

    $ node -v

To install Node, follow the instructions at https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

#### Java

#### Ruby

### Installing dependencies

    $ npm install

If using the development dependencies from the repository branches, you will also need to delete the `node_modules\encender\node_modules` folder to prevent encender from using the packed version of cql-worker.    

### Test

    $ npm run cql-to-elm
    $ npm run test-cql

To run tests against $apply operation:

    $ npm run sushi
    $ npm run test-apply

These are intended for local testing and can only be run after the CQL tests have successfully executed as they use the Bundle outputs from CQL tests as inputs to the $apply operation.    

### Build

Uses templates and scripts from https://github.com/cqframework/sample-content-ig. Automatically creates Library resources and adds both CQL and ELM to content as Base64. 

    $ ./_refresh.sh
    $ ./_genonce.sh
